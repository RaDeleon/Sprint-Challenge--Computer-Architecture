# what is alu and why alu is used?
- Arithmetic logic unit
- Used to perform all arithmetic computations addition,multiplication and comparing shit. ALU is just one component of the CPU
----
# why does the cpu use stack?
- First ALU operation are performed using the stack data. 
### The advantages of Stack based CPU organization –

- Efficient computation of complex arithmetic expressions.
- Execution of instructions is fast because operand data are stored in consecutive memory locations.
- Length of instruction is short as they do not have address field.

### The disadvantages of Stack based CPU organization –
- The size of the program increases.

# convert binary to hex?

Convert 1010 to hex

- Binary numbers can only be 1 and 0. Hexadecimal numbers can be 0-9, or A-F, since hexadecimal is base-16. You can convert any binary string to hexadecimal. If you don't have 4 digits, add zeros to the front to make it four digits. So, 01 would become 0001

1. ### Each of the four numbers signifies a type of number decimal system number. The last digit is the one's place. 

1010
1(*8) 0(*4) 1(*2) 0(*1)

2. 
### Count out how many of each "place" you have. 

1(*8) 0(*4) 1(*2) 0(*1)
======
8 0 2 0

8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10

3.
### Once we have our new hex numbers we add them up.

* 1010
* 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}
* 8 0 2 0
* 8+0+2+0= 10

10 > 9 
* Change any number above 9 into a letter. So we don't get confused when reading hex

10=A

11=B

12=C

13=D

14=E

15=F




## Others:

**Convert 1 to hex** 
* add zeros to it so 0001
* 0:8 0:4 0:2 0:1
* 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
